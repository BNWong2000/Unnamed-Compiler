# Planned Roadmap for the project (long long term)

The project here is intended mostly as a fun learning exercise, and a way for me to learn and achieve my personal goals. As such, I've laid out a roadmap about potential ideas for where I want to take this project, and how it might fit into my goals. 

1 - Complete the compiler
    a - Implement library functions
    b - Implement Optimization
    c - Add an option for using the LLVM toolchain instead of my Optimizations

2 - Design a runtime system or assembler or something. 

3 - Build an IDE for my code (develop a from scratch GUI library)

4 - Put it on the web
