# A Compiler for a C-like Language

Details on the nature of the language can be found in the [Language Specification](Language-Spec.md)

Currently, the plan for this language is to compile the specified language into ARM64, to be run on my apple m1 machine. 
I intend on writing my own optimizations and backend, however I also intend on using the LLVM compiler toolchain as well. 

For more details on my plans for this project, see the [roadmap](roadmap.md). 

## Goals of the Project:
This project is ultimately a hobby/learning project for me. Major goals include:
- Building on the learnings of the Compilers class I took in university. 
- Writing the project in C without the use of scanner generators or compiler compilers like lex or yacc/bison.
- Writing my own data structures for the Compiler.
- Attempting to write a more "realistic" language (rather than more "toy-like" languages)
- Applying the skills I learn over time into the project, as I gain more experience through reading, courses, and my day-job.
